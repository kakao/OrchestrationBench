      Since it’s the summer vacation season and a weekend, most time slots are already
      sold out. It would be best to book quickly.


      Currently available trains are as follows:


      6:00 AM departure → 6:59 AM arrival (Almost sold out)


      11:30 AM departure → 12:29 PM arrival (11 seats left)


      2:00 PM departure → 3:02 PM arrival (5 seats left)


      The standard coach fare for all options is $23.70.


      Unfortunately, the popular 9 AM trains and all departures after 4 PM are already
      sold out.


      Which time would you like me to book for you? Since seats are limited, let me
      know right away and I’ll proceed with the reservation.


      ----------


      To complete your booking, I’ll need the following details:


      Number of passengers


      How many people will be traveling? (e.g., 2 adults, 1 child)


      Seat class


      Amtrak offers standard coach and the more spacious business class. Which would
      you prefer?


      Contact information


      I’ll need a phone number to send your booking confirmation and mobile ticket.


      Please provide your preferred departure time along with these three details,
      and I’ll attempt reservation immediately and let you know the result.
