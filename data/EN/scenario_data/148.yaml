    content: '◾ Program Introduction: Counseling Center


      Counseling Center is a program that provides in-depth counseling and solutions,
      offering expert advice and guidance to people dealing with a wide range of concerns.
      Here’s how it differs from similar shows:


      - Format: Counseling Center focuses on personal struggles and individual issues,
      while My Precious Child centers on family and parent-child relationship challenges.

      - Audience: Counseling Center offers counseling for people of all ages, whereas
      My Precious Child is specifically aimed at parents dealing with issues related
      to their children and family dynamics.


      Deborah Tillman appears in both programs to help resolve various problems.



      ◾ Providing Psychological Counseling and Advice


      Stress from conflicts with teenage children is a natural process that many parents
      experience. Here are some tips that may help manage it:


      - Consider your child’s perspective: Adolescence is a time of many changes,
      so try to understand your child''s point of view.

      - Encourage open communication: Create an environment where honest conversations
      can happen.

      - Set consistent rules: Make household expectations clear and apply them consistently.

      - Practice self-care: Parents should also take time to manage their own stress.

      - Seek professional help: If needed, consulting a family counselor can be very
      beneficial.


      By trying these approaches, you may be able to reduce stress, and if necessary,
      consider seeking professional counseling support.'
