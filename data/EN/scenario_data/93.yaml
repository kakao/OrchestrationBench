      Image: https://plantstore.example.com/images/areca.jpg


      ▶ Air-purifying plants are more than just pretty decor—they actively help clean
      the air indoors. Here’s how they work:


      1. Absorb harmful substances in the air through the pores on their leaves


      2. Break down pollutants in the soil with the help of microorganisms at the
      roots


      3. Release oxygen through photosynthesis


      4. Help regulate indoor humidity, improving dry environments


      Once you’ve chosen a plant, I’ll need the recipient’s name and contact information.'
