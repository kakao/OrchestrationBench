      1. Who will become America''s ''National AI''?—15 contenders including OpenAI,
      Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Anthropic

      The US government is launching a project to select a “National AI” to support
      the development of American large language models (LLMs) and reduce reliance
      on foreign technologies. A total of 15 teams, including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft,
      Meta, and Anthropic, have applied. The five finalists will receive extensive
      support such as federal GPU access, datasets, and workforce funding, which is
      expected to strengthen America’s AI competitiveness significantly.

      2. Microsoft unveils its AI ecosystem roadmap—expanding to biotech, finance,
      and semiconductor B2B markets

      At the AI Forward Summit 2025, Microsoft AI Research introduced the Copilot
      Ecosystem, showcasing its upgraded Copilot Foundation Model 4.0 and enterprise
      AI solutions. Partnering with NASDAQ and TSMC, Microsoft is entering the biotech,
      finance, and semiconductor B2B markets, with contracts already exceeding $75
      million.

      3. “Big Tech offers from abroad? No thanks”—Calls grow for an American "Sovereign
      AI"

      US academicians and policymakers view the Independent AI Foundation Model project
      as a chance to prevent talent brain drain and develop world-class AI. However,
      challenges remain, including access to high-quality data and regulatory reforms
      needed for global competitiveness. Experts stress the importance of government–private
      sector collaboration to build AI models that can succeed beyond domestic use.

      4. OpenAI releases GPT-4.5 Turbo for free commercial use—expanding the ecosystem

      OpenAI has released its lightweight inference model GPT-4.5 Turbo as a free
      open-source tool for commercial use, boosting US AI capabilities. Despite cutting
      training costs to just 1% of previous levels, the model demonstrates excellent
      performance in reasoning, English tasks, and coding, contributing to the growth
      of the US AI ecosystem.
