      \ using Python, helping you learn by doing.\nurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwC8dBqGgIw\n\
      \nAll of these videos are free and available on YouTube. Depending on your needs,\
      \ you can choose a course that focuses more on foundational concepts or one\
      \ that emphasizes hands-on practice.\n\n\nWhat is AI?\nArtificial Intelligence\
      \ refers to computer systems designed to mimic human intelligence, incorporating\
      \ technologies such as machine learning and deep learning. These systems are\
      \ built to perform tasks that usually require human thinking, learning, and\
      \ decision making.\n(Source: Wikipedia – Artificial Intelligence)\n\nKey AI\
      \ Information:\n\nWhat is AI?\nAI goes beyond simple automation. It refers to\
      \ systems that can learn and make decisions based on data. Examples include\
      \ voice recognition, image analysis, chatbots, and recommendation algorithms.\
      \ AI is already applied in fields such as education, finance, manufacturing,\
      \ and healthcare.\n(Source: Wikipedia – Artificial Intelligence)\n\nAI Trends\
      \ for 2025\nThe use of AI is rapidly expanding across industries. Notable areas\
      \ include generative AI (like GPT), autonomous driving, AI-assisted medical\
      \ diagnostics, and industrial automation such as smart factories. Generative\
      \ AI in particular is growing quickly in content creation, workflow automation,\
      \ and customer service.\n(Source: Tech Trend 2025)\n\nAI Ethics and Regulation\n\
      As AI develops, ethical issues such as transparency, accountability, and bias\
      \ prevention are becoming increasingly important. Global discussions on legal\
      \ and ethical frameworks are underway. The European Union is leading with AI\
      \ legislation, while companies worldwide are creating their own ethical guidelines.\n\
      (Source: BBC – AI Ethics Article)\n\nAI is no longer a distant future technology—it’s\
      \ already a driving force reshaping our lives and society today. If you’re interested\
