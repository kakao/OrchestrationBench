    content: I was selected in the first round of an affordable housing lottery for
      two income-restricted apartments—Astor View (near Astor Place) and Prospect
      Central (near Prospect Park). Both are well-priced with great facilities, so
      I’m torn. How long would the 8:00 a.m. bus or subway commute take to the Aurora
      Labs campus in Jersey City? Please check on Google Maps. Also, any info on public
      housing in Brooklyn?
