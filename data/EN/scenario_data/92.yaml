    content: '▶ Here’s a summary of what to prepare to become a high school physical
      education teacher (US, New York example).


      — Overview

      - In the US, K–12 teachers are licensed by each state. To teach high school
      PE, complete a state-approved teacher preparation program and acquire a state
      teaching license.

      - Public and private schools have similar expectations; private schools hire
      directly and they may show some flexibility in certification preferences.


      — Required Steps

      - Earn a bachelor’s degree in Physical Education or Kinesiology, or complete
      a state-approved teacher preparation program with PE focus (includes fieldwork
      and supervised student teaching).

      - Pass the required state teacher exams — in New York: NYSTCE Educating All
      Students (EAS) and the Physical Education Content Specialty Test (CST).

      - Complete the mandated trainings/workshops — DASA, Child Abuse Identification
      and Reporting, and School Violence Prevention (SAVE).

      - Complete fingerprinting and background check, and set up your state certification
      account (in New York: TEACH).

      - Apply for the initial teaching certificate; later advance to Professional
      certificate after meeting experience and graduate-degree requirements.


      — Optional / Helpful

      - First Aid and CPR/AED (often preferred and sometimes required for coaching
      assignments).

      - Coaching authorizations or additional Health/PE endorsements, depending on
      district or league policies.


      — Private Schools

      - Independent schools recruit directly via school websites and major job boards
      (e.g., NAIS, NYSAIS).

      - Prepare resume, references, demo lesson, and interview materials; coaching
      experience is a strong plus.


      — Recommended Actions

      - Confirm your exact certificate title and requirements in your target state’s
      official certification portal.

      - Register for state exams, schedule the required workshops early, and complete
      fingerprinting ahead of time.

      - Assemble a teaching portfolio (unit and lesson plans, assessments, classroom
      management approach) and track fieldwork/student-teaching hours.

      - Set job alerts on NAIS/NYSAIS and individual school sites; tailor materials
      separately for public vs. independent schools.


      — What I can generate next

      - A one-page checklist with links (exam registration, workshops, fingerprinting).

      - A 90-day study and application timeline aligned to your target exam dates.'
