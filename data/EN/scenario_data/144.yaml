      ◾For lunch with Grandma, I recommend a few quiet restaurants near the Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania Bus Terminal. Here are some options:


      1. Bank & Bourbon (Loews Philadelphia Hotel)


      1200 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 • +1 215-231-7300

      Calm dining room, comfy seating, American menu.

      ~6–8 min walk from the terminal.

      Reserve for noon; request booth and low-noise seating.


      2. The Wayward (East Market)


      1170 Ludlow St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 • +1 215-258-9430

      Bright, relaxed brasserie; typically quiet at lunch.

      ~5–7 min walk.

      Reserve for 12:00; ask for a table away from the bar.


      3. The Love (Rittenhouse Square)


      130 S 18th St, Philadelphia, PA 19103 • +1 215-433-1555

      Cozy, polished, conversation-friendly.

      ~15–18 min walk or a short taxi/ride-hail.

      Reserve; note that it’s slightly farther but serene.


      These restaurants are open on Thanksgiving Day, November 27 at noon. I recommend
      making a reservation in advance for those that allow it!'
