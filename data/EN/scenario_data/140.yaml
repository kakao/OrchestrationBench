      \ Fund) is an investment vehicle designed to track the performance of a specific\
      \ index. Because it is listed on a stock exchange, it can be traded in real\
      \ time just like individual stocks. ETFs generally feature low costs and high\
      \ liquidity, including the advantage of diversifying across different asset\
      \ classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. These qualities make ETFs\
      \ an accessible way for investors to gain diversification at relatively low\

      \ be used strategically to pursue long-term portfolio diversification and stable\
      \ returns.\n\nETFs are benchmarked against various market indices, and portfolio\
      \ performance is adjusted to replicate those indices. Under certain conditions,\
      \ ETFs are also tax-efficient, helping investors minimize capital gains tax\
      \ burdens. Since ETFs disclose their holdings daily, investors can easily see\
      \ the underlying assets. However, ETF prices can fluctuate with market volatility\
