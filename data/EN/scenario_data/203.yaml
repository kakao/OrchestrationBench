      ### Alphabet Stock Information


      As of Friday, February 14, 2026, Alphabet’s stock prices are as follows:


      *   Class A (GOOGL): Current price $185.79

      *   Class C (GOOG): Current price $187.55


      ### Difference Between Class A and Class C Shares


      The key difference between the two share classes is voting rights.


      Class A (GOOGL) shares carry one vote per share, whereas Class C (GOOG) shares
      have no voting rights. This means that Class A shareholders can vote on Google’s
      corporate matters. Because of the value of voting rights, there is usually a
      slight price difference between the two classes.
