      ■ Miami Weather This Weekend


      - Saturday, June 11, 2022: Sunny and hot. (High 86°F / Low 75°F, 10% chance
      of rain)

      - Sunday, June 12, 2022: Mostly cloudy with likelihood of afternoon showers.
      (High 82°F / Low 73°F, 60% chance of rain)


      Since rain is likely on Sunday, I searched for popular women’s rain boots (size
      7.5) from Puma.


      I recommend the "Puma Women’s Chelsea Rain Boots."

      Price: about $59
