    content: 'Here’s an overview of the estimated budget you’ll need for a one-week
      trip to Austria, along with the current exchange rate in US dollars.


      ■ Estimated Expenses for One Week in Austria (per person, excluding airfare)

      The cost of a 7-day trip to Austria varies by travel style. For one person including
      accommodation, meals, transportation, and sightseeing (excluding airfare), you
      can expect:

      • Budget travel: about €70–100 per day (hostels, inexpensive meals)

      • Mid-range travel: about €150–200 per day (mid-range hotels, restaurant meals)

      • Luxury travel: €300+ per day (luxury hotels, fine dining, shopping)


      For a typical mid-range trip, budgeting €1,050–1,400 for the week is recommended.


      ■ Current Exchange Rate (as of October 11, 2025)

      When buying euros in cash, 1 EUR ≈ 1.51550 USD.


      ■ Recommended Budget in US Dollars

      Based on the exchange rate above, a typical mid-range one-week trip would cost
      around:

      • €1,050 → approx. $1,590

      • €1,400 → approx. $2,120


      So, planning for a budget of about $1,600–2,100 should be reasonable.

      (Of course, actual expenses may vary depending on your travel style and shopping
      plans.)'
