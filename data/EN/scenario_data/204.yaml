      \ Gastritis – Summary Information\"\n    summary: \"Atrophic gastritis is a\
      \ condition where chronic inflammation of the stomach lining causes thinning\
      \ of the mucosal layer and reduction in acid-secreting cells. This can impair\
      \ digestion and, if left untreated for a long time, increase the risk of stomach\

      \ atrophy.\"\n      - title: \"Autoimmune gastritis\"\n        content: \"Occurs\
      \ when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own stomach cells. This\

      \ of spicy or salty foods, smoking, alcohol, long-term use of certain medications\

      \ \"The most accurate diagnostic method. Doctors directly observe the stomach\

      \ H. pylori infection is confirmed, eradication therapy with antibiotics is\
