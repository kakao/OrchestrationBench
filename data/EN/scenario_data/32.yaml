      ▶ Investment Tips

      - Monthly dividend stocks provide steady cash flow, which can offer peace of
      mind and allow reinvestment for compounding growth.

      - A high dividend yield doesn’t always mean it’s a good investment—always check
      the business model and financial stability.

      - Diversifying across multiple stocks helps reduce risk.'
