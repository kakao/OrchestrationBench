    content: '1. Talking about the feeling of anxiety itself


      ▶ Vague anxiety can arise naturally even without a clear external cause. It
      may come from internal stress, brain chemistry, accumulated fatigue, or uncertainty
      about the future. Instead of trying to force it away, it helps accept your current
      state and create emotional routines such as breathing exercises or meditation.


      Also:


      * Keep a journal or track your emotions to observe patterns

      * Consider speaking with a mental health professional if needed



      2. It may also relate to your MBTI type (based on ENFJ)


      ▶ ENFJs are sensitive to others’ emotions and they value harmony, but this often
      means that they neglect their own inner needs, allowing emotions to build up.
      The more you focus on others instead of yourself, the more often you may experience
      sudden waves of anxiety without a clear reason.


      * Using an emotion journal or a tracking app to organize your inner state regularly
      is highly recommended.
