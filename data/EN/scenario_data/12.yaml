    content: '▶ Overview


      Time window: Jul 14–20, 2025


      Scope: Multiple US states experienced short-burst, high-intensity storms that
      overwhelmed drainage systems, disrupted transport, and prompted numerous water
      rescues.


      ▶ Article Summaries


      1. Houston Chronicle — “Tropical downpours inundate Houston; hundreds of high-water
      rescues reported”

      Slow-moving tropical downpours flooded bayous and major roadways across Houston.
      Authorities carried out hundreds of high-water rescues, and several neighborhoods
      experienced power outages.


      2. St. Louis Post-Dispatch — “Overnight deluge triggers flash floods across
      St. Louis suburbs”

      Stalled thunderstorms produced flash flooding in suburban areas, swamping underpasses
      and basements, disrupting transit, and necessitating multiple water rescues.
      Damage assessments were initiated.


      3. AZCentral — “Monsoon storms unleash sudden flooding in Phoenix area”

      Intense monsoon cells delivered heavy rain over a short period, sending water
      through washes and low-lying streets. Fire officials warned drivers to avoid
      flooded crossings due to rapid, hazardous rises.


      4. NJ.com — “Severe thunderstorms swamp parts of New Jersey; flash flood warnings
      issued”

      Severe thunderstorms overwhelmed drainage in several towns, flooding homes and
      roads. Authorities issued flash flood warnings, closed local roads, and urged
      residents to relocate vehicles from flood-prone areas.


      ▶ Cross-Cutting Insights


      Pattern: Stalled/Slow cells → drainage capacity exceeded → flash floods in lowlands/underpasses
      → rescues, outages, and transit disruptions.


      Risk zones: Underpasses, bayous/washes, river-adjacent lowlands, and underground
      spaces.


      Operational impacts: Emergency response surges, temporary power restoration
      efforts, localized detours and closures.


      ▶ One-Line Takeaway


      Across Houston, St. Louis, Phoenix, and New Jersey, stalled storms and monsoon
      bursts triggered simultaneous flash-flood events, leading to widespread rescues,
      outages, and travel disruptions within the week.
