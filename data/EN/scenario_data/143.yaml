    content: BLACKPINK is finally making a full-group comeback! Show me the teaser
      video for it. Also, check the New York concert schedule and book me a ticket.
      Before the show, find a good nearby spot to eat. Since I’ll be going alone,
      I’d prefer a Korean restaurant that’s comfortable for solo dining.
