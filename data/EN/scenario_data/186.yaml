    content: 'Sure, let me compare the options for traveling from New York to Boston
      this Friday morning, focusing on time and cost.


      - Flight (JFK → BOS)


      Travel time: About 1 hour 10 minutes (excluding airport transfer and check-in)

      Estimated cost: $140 ~ $160

      Notes: Fastest travel time, but the total duration may increase due to airport
      transfers and waiting.


      - Train (Amtrak)


      Travel time: About 3 hours 30 minutes ~ 4 hours

      Estimated cost: $120 ~ $160

      Notes: Convenient city-center access and reliable schedules, making it a preferred
      option.


      - Express Bus


      Travel time: About 4 hours 15 minutes ~ 4 hours 30 minutes

      Estimated cost: $40 ~ $45

      Notes: Cheapest option, but travel time can vary depending on traffic.


      ✨ Overall Recommendation

      Considering both time and cost, the Amtrak train at about 3 hours 30 minutes
      for around $120 looks like the most balanced choice.
